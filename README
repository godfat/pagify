== DESCRIPTION:

 Pagination tools for Array(or custom class), DataMapper and ActiveRecord

== FEATURES:

* Aims to be as flexible as possible
* Separate intrusive "pagify" method and Array/DataMapper/ActiveRecord Pager.
* Separate view helpers. There's only html helper right now.

== SYNOPSIS:

 # for fast will_paginate replacement:
 require 'pagify/active_record'
 require 'pagify/helper/rails'

 # in controller:
 @photos = Photo.pagify(:page => params[:page])

 # in view:
 would_paginate(@photos)



 # basic DataMapper usage:
 require 'pagify/data_mapper'

 class User
   include DataMapper::Resource
   property :id, Serial
   property :name, String
   has n, :pets
 end

 class Pet
   include DataMapper::Resource
   property :id, Serial
   property :name, String
   belongs_to :user
 end

 User.pagify :page => 1, :per_page => 10 # => create a page contains users
 User.all(:name => 'godfat').pagify      # => create a page contains users named godfat

 User.get(1).pets.pagify                 # => create a page contains pets owned by user 1



 # basic html helper usage:
 require 'pagify/helper/html'

 # create a string with page links.
 Pet.pagify.pager.html.links(params[:page]){ |page|
   # the block result would be used as url for each page
   "/pets/list?page=#{page}"
 }

 Pagify::Helper::HTML.setting[:prev_text] = '<]' # globally change html setting
 # NOTE: if you would like to use instance level setting, you shouldn't use method pagify,
 # NOTE: new your own DataMapperPager or so to remember instance level html setting.
 # NOTE: for example, see below:

 class Pet
 # same as above
   def self.page num
     @pager ||= begin
       pager = Pagify::DataMapperPager.new(:per_page => 20)
       # below would be pager instance level setting
       # you can setup global setting mentioned above in your init script perhaps
       pager.html.setting[:separator] = ' . '
       pager.html.setting[:ellipsis]  = '...'
       pager
     end
     @pager.page(num)
   end
 end

 # then you would use Pet.page(3) or user.pets.page(2) to retrieve data

 # this would create next/prev links only.
 Pet.page(1).html.links_navigate{ |page|
   "/pets/list?page=#{page}"
 }

 # this would create next/prev links and other page links
 pet_pager.page(1).html.links_full{ |page|
   "/pets/show?page=#{page}"
 }

 # and you can build your pager from scratch via BasicPager.
 # e.g. BasicPager.new :fetcher => lambda{|*a|[]}, :counter => lambda{0}
 # this would be similar to Pagify::NullPager.

 # you can disable null page via passing :null_page => false to any pager,
 # or set pager.null_page = false; anytime.

 # see example or test for more examples (and use case for ActiveRecordPager).

== REQUIREMENTS:

* for DataMapper   Pager: dm-core and dm-aggregates 0.9.6 and above
