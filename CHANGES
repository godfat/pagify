policy changed. null page was no longer a singleton. see reason below:

  i encountered a strange problem, where:
    
    pager[10].pager.per_page != pager[1].pager.per_page
  
  because BasicPage#pager would refer to original pager,
  while NullPage#pager would always refer to NullPager's singleton.

  i think i should have not made NullPage be a singleton,
  because we got have some way to keep page.pager.per_page
  consist to the value we original setup. then we could write
  something like this:

    (0...page.pager.per_page).each{ ... }

  that is, we don't have to keep pager around, and if you have
  page, then you have pager. so now that NullPage was no longer
  a singleton, and null_page.pager would return the original pager.

  keep NullPager being a singleton though, and it should always
  return the same page which refer the singleton null pager.
